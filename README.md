# DropNet_Reproduced_Results

DropNet: Reducing Neural Network Complexity via Iterative Pruning


This is a Deep Learning course based project.
Use a research paper with or without code available, we have to produce the results shown in the paper and we have to produce similar results from another dataset

Used in the paper dataset - CIFAR10
Reproduced the results - Tiny ImageNET dataset

** Please Provide GPU for the code to run properly **

1. There are two IPYNB files these can be run in local desktop, 1 being the reproduced results file and other being the analysis from other dataset
2. The Results folder contains the graphs of the early_stopping, training_accuracy, testing_accuracy, and validation_accuracy of different models.
3. These result graphs are also attached in the report file also.
